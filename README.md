# CAE - Convolutional Autoencoder
Convolutional Autoencoder applied to CIFAR dataset

# Presentation
Autoencoders are neural networks used in unsupervised learning, in order to perform data compressing. The input is compressed in a latent-space representation and we try to reconstruct the input from this representation. 
Convolutional Neural Networks are very successful in image recognition. The shared parameters make the CNNs scale to high-dimensional problems and outperforms fully-connected neural networks.

Here, Convolutional Auto-encoders uses the scaling abilities of convolutional layers in order to perform dimensionnality reduction.
